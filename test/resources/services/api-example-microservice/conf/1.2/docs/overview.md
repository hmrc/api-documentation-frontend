This is an example API that allows software developers to test that 
their applications can connect with the HMRC API Platform. It also acts 
as a hands-on tutorial for developers to get started with HMRC APIs.

It includes resources for testing access to the three different access 
levels:

- _Say Hello World_ is an example of an unrestricted endpoint
- _Say Hello User_ is an example of a user-restricted endpoint
- _Say Hello Application_ is an example of an application-restricted endpoint


Further details of the different access levels are given on the 
[Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.
