        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">API statuses</h1>


        <p class="govuk-body">We release different versions of APIs as they’re developed and updated.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We give each API version a status to explain who can use it, and what you can expect from it.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Status meanings</h2>
        <h3 id="alpha" class="govuk-heading-s">Alpha</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">This version is being developed. You cannot subscribe to it yet, but you can read documentation and provide feedback before it’s released.</p>

        <h3 id="beta" class="govuk-heading-s">Beta</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">This version is available for use. Some versions stay in beta for a long time.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Changes might be made that are either:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>backwards-compatible, meaning they will not break your integration with the API</li>
            <li>breaking changes that will break your integration with the API</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">If breaking changes are made, you’ll need to update your application to integrate with the API again.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Subscribe to emails about the API to get information about changes.</p>

        <h3 id="stable" class="govuk-heading-s">Stable</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">This version is available for use. It may be updated, but any changes should not break your integration with the API.</p>

        <h3 id="deprecated" class="govuk-heading-s">Deprecated</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">This version has been replaced and will be removed. You should use the latest version of the API instead.</p>

        <h3 id="private" class="govuk-heading-s">Private APIs</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Some APIs are marked as ‘private’. This means they’re in development and you cannot subscribe to them in the Developer Hub.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">API development teams may allow some users to access and test alpha, beta, trial or stable versions of private APIs however.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="@{applicationConfig.developerFrontendUrl}/developer/support">Contact our support team</a> to request access to view full documentation and endpoints, and to use private APIs.</p>
