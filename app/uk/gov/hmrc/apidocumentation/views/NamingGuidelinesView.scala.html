    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Application naming guidelines</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will check the name of your application when you request production credentials.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">While you are testing your sandbox application, you can name it whatever you like.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using your organisation’s name</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The name of your production application should be the same name as your organisation. This is because if you have customers, we show the application name when they <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="@controllers.routes.AuthorisationController.authorisationPage().url">give permission</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Using a name your users recognise is better than a string of letters or numbers.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using HMRC in the name</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Using HMRC, or making any reference to HMRC as part of the name is not allowed and we may reject your request for production credentials.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Existing names</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The name of your production application can’t be the same or similar to the name of an application which has already requested production credentials on the Developer Hub.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">‘The same’ means a name that’s either identical, or where the only difference is punctuation or a special character. For example, Fast Track Tax App is treated the same as F&#64;st Track Tax App.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">‘Similar’ means a name that’s close enough to another to confuse users. For example, Fast Track Tax App is too similar to Fast Trax Tax App.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Exceptions</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">This doesn’t apply if the admins of the existing application give you permission to use the name.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Trademarked and registered names</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your application’s name must not be the same or similar to a trademarked name that's registered by another business outside the HMRC Developer Hub.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">For example, you can’t register the Barclays tax application, without permission from Barclays bank.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Offensive names</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your name can’t contain offensive words or phrases.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Misleading names</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your application’s name can’t mislead users into believing your application has special status or power. Such names might associate your application with government, local authorities or institutions. For example, the Royal Tax App could be misleading.</p>
