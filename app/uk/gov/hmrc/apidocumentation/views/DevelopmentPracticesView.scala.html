  <p class="govuk-body">The HMRC API Platform uses DevOps practices, iterative development, continuous integration, continuous testing and continuous delivery to make

    <p class="govuk-body">HMRC Developer Hub is for software developers who write software that integrates with HMRC APIs.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you are developing software that uses HMRC APIs, you only need 1 Developer Hub production application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You don’t need to create applications for each of your customers.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your customers’ traffic is isolated through Oauth tokens and does not need isolating through multiple application registrations.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to avoid your application failing without warning</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should avoid unintentionally tightly coupling your application to HMRC.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Tight coupling means a set of systems are dependent on one another. Making a change in a tightly coupled setup requires changes to both systems.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Loose coupling reduces dependencies and ensures non-breaking changes have no impact on your application.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">HTTPS certificates can change</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The HMRC API Platform’s HTTPS certificates can change. This includes the leaf certificate, intermediary certificates and the root certificate.</p>

    <div class="govuk-warning-text warning-icon-fix">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon warning-icon-ui-fix" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
      <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        If you import any HMRC specific certificates into your keystore or load balancer, then your application may fail to connect when certificate changes occur.
      </strong>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">Use a global root CA keystore and do not pin HMRC specific certificates</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">IP addresses can change</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">You might need to configure your network so your software can access our API Platform and token generation.
      If your software is installed on end user devices, they might also need to configure their own network.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We have fixed domain names, but cannot provide static IP addresses, so you need to configure your network access in your proxy, not your firewall.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Configure your proxy to allow full access to the following domains, including HTTP <code class="code--slim">GET</code>,
      <code class="code--slim">POST</code>, <code class="code--slim">PUT</code> and <code class="code--slim">DELETE</code>.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For testing in sandbox:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><code class="code--slim">test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk</code></li>
      <li><code class="code--slim">test-www.tax.service.gov.uk</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">For production use:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><code class="code--slim">api.service.hmrc.gov.uk</code></li>
      <li><code class="code--slim">www.tax.service.gov.uk</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Oauth flow can change</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We do not support software that automatically drives the web interfaces of the OAuth grant flow.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We regularly make changes to the OAuth grant flow and any changes could break automated logins. We will not advise you of any OAuth changes in advance.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The HMRC API Platform does not support <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol">cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).</a>
      It is not possible to call our APIs from client-side code within a web browser, for example using Ajax.</p>

  <section id="hmrc-changes-that-will-affect-your-application">
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">HMRC changes that will affect your application</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">A breaking change is a change to the HMRC API platform that requires you to make changes to your software, so it continues to work.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We try to avoid breaking changes, but sometimes they need to be made.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Breaking changes can be:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>API specific (for example retiring a stable version of an API)</li>
      <li>platform wide (for example retiring support for insecure TLS versions and cipher suites)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
      <p class="govuk-body">You will receive 6 months notice before breaking changes are made in production.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">Where possible breaking changes will be published to the sandbox environment first before production.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You will have time to test any changes in the sandbox environment before changes are made in production.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you have an automated test pack, we recommend you run your tests weekly against sandbox.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">See the <a class="govuk-link" href="@controllers.routes.DocumentationController.referenceGuidePage()">reference guide</a> for actions you need to take to make sure your application integrates with HMRC.</p>
